## Functions

### metadata viewer

- permissionset viewer: view content of permissionset, see assigned apex classes, fields, objects, etc. Option to add permissions, but keep in mind restrictions like required fields, etc. General easy and quick view/ edit of permissionsets

- other viewers? think what else can be useful

### tests

- can we show the test coverage percentage per class in the explorer?
- when a file is opened, check if we have test coverage for it and if the highlight is enabled, show it in the editor (the highlight is a setting of the salesforce extension and when you open a file it does not show the highlight, you have to togggle it off and on to see it)


Improvements
- permissionset viewer: 
  - i can see most content, but not all, support all types of permissions
  - Add option to add extra permissions, but keep in mind restrictions like required fields, etc.
  - add button to switch between xml and the UI view

- org list
  - sort by type, devhubs, production, sandbox,
  - scratches sort by default org, name (default always on top)


apex logs:
 - when the filter is active (debug, soql, dml), color the icon so the user can see it is active

- rename this extention to: Adure SFX Toolkit
